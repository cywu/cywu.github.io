                    When you search with Bing International in China, you notice that Bing would produce a pop-up that contains the Chinese translation of the word that you happen to mouse over, that totally distracts you and that obscures what you want to see. (Bing International is a special version of Bing that conforms to censorship by China. Don't be fooled by the name.) There is a switch to turn this bug/feature off, but it enables itself again when you reload Bing. This `optimisation' for the Chinese gradually gets on your nerves. Here is a solution.

                    I use <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">uBlock<sub>0</sub></a> to block Ads already, so why not ask it to block whatever that is that produces the translations? After digging through the html/javascript code a bit with the help of developer's tools in Firefox, I found the culprit with the glaring name of HoverTranslation.js. Thus all I need to do is to add the following to the `My filters' configuration of <a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/">uBlock<sub>0</sub></a>.
                    <pre>
                        <code>
    ! Blocks Bing's auto translation
    www.bing.com/*/HoverTranslation.js
                        </code>
                    </pre>
                </p>
                <h2>Off-topic:</h2>

                    It looks that I can keep a blog here. Thus I tried to learn how to automate some tedious repetitious parts on, oops, Bing China and received some discouragement.

                <p>
                    On the other hand, Bing International gives me go.

                    To be honest, my friend in Boston said the real Bing also discouraged her.

                    Let's pretend that we will have a non-static site. Wordpress is a good choice, but it has the record of being once blocked by GFW. Medium is currently being blocked because of the Panama Papers. Theoretically I can run whatever blog software I want on my own relay server, but it may get blocked at any time without prior notice and I definitely do not enjoy having to set up blog software again and again. Conclusion: GFW is severely limiting my options.
