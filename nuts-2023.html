                        In this talk, we will start with the local theta correspondence between two-fold coverings of algebraic groups over local fields and then discuss when the theta lifts are non-zero. Although in general we cannot embed the algebraic groups in a reductive dual pair into their two-fold coverings, for some of them we can embed them into their extensions by the circle group. Using such embeddings, the local theta correspondence induces a correspondence between irreducible representations of the algebraic groups whose theta lifts are non-zero.

                        The infamous Ramanujan tau-function is the starting point for many mysterious conjectures and difficult open problems within the realm of modular forms. In this talk, I will discuss some of our recent results pertaining to odd values of the Ramanujan tau-function. We use a combination of tools which include the Primitive Divisor Theorem of Bilu, Hanrot and Voutier, bounds for solutions to Thue--Mahler equations due to Bugeaud and Gyory, and the modular approach via Galois representations of Frey--Hellegouarch elliptic curves. This is joint work with Mike Bennett (UBC), Adela Gherga (Warwick) and Samir Siksek (Warwick).

                        <p>In the overview of the theta correspondence, we stated the Howe duality theorem as a bijection between certain representations of two-fold coverings of the two groups in a reductive dual pair. In a lot of cases, this bijection induces a bijection between certain representations of the two groups themselves. To describe this, we need to classify reductive dual pairs in symplectic groups.</p>

                       <p>The Weil representation, also called the oscillator representation, originates from the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The representation-theoretic description of one-dimensional quantum mechanical systems involves certain representations of the real Heisenberg group, the group of 3×3 upper triangular real matrices with all diagonal entries 1. These representations can be classified by a theorem called the Stone–von Neumann theorem, which can then be used to construct the Weil representation of Mp(2,ℝ). The theory of the real Heisenberg group leads to a similar theory of the Heisenberg group of a locally compact Hausdorff Abelian group. The application of this theory to vector spaces provides the foundation of the theta correspondence.</p>

                       <p>In this talk, we will start from the classical theory of the real Heisenberg group. After that, we will review some results about locally compact Hausdorff Abelian groups and then discuss the general theory of Heisenberg groups.</p>

                        <p>The objective of this talk is to introduce and to prove congruences related to modular forms.  Our main motivation to study such congruences is the fact that these can be used to give evidence in support of well known conjectures in Number Theory like Birch Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and the Tamagawa conjecture of Bloch and Kato. In order to do so, we use the theory of half-integer weight modular forms and the arithmetic significance of their Fourier coefficients as captured by  Waldpurger’s theorem.</p>
                        <p>We will show how mod p congruences between modular forms in general transcend to similar mod p congruences between half-integer weight modular forms with slightly shifted Fourier coefficients. We try to use a recipe in our proof that can be easily generalised to Hilbert modular forms over totally real quadratic fields of narrow class number 1.</p>

                        Let <var>K</var> be a <var>p</var>-adic local field. We classify de Rham crystals over the absolute prismatic site of 𝒪<sub><var>K</var></sub> using certain log-connections and certain nearly de Rham Galois representations. We also compare their various cohomologies. This is joint work with Min and Wang.
