                            I’ll begin with Bost’s generalization of the p-curvature
                            conjecture, and describe the classical geometric concepts at play such
                            as connections, parallel transport, and associated horizontal
                            subbundle. This naturally motivates the discovery of the Gauss-Manin
                            connection on algebraic de Rham cohomology, and its non-abelian
                            analogue due to Simpson. I’ll state Katz’s theorem that the
                            p-curvature conjecture (equivalently, Bost's conjecture) holds for the
                            abelian Gauss-Manin connection, and outline the ingredients to make
                            that statement, such as the Hodge filtration, conjugate filtration,
                            and Kodaira-Spencer map. I’ll then define non-abelian analogues of
                            these objects, and state a theorem which suitably equates them. This
                            is the non-abelian analogue of part 1 (the characteristic p step) of
                            Katz’s theorem, and is progress towards proving Bost for the
                            non-abelian Gauss-Manin connection. There is also a transcendental
                            characteristic 0 part 2 of Katz' theorem, but its non-abelian analogue
                            is more mysterious.

                            The absolute Galois group of a local or global field can
                            be better understood by studying its representations, important classes of which are constructed
                            from geometric objects such as elliptic or modular curves. The results of a line of work
                            initiated by Serre, Momose and Ribet suggest that certain interesting symmetries of a Galois
                            representation constructed this way are in bijection with the symmetries of its underlying
                            geometric object. We present a recent result in this direction for two-dimensional
                            representations, obtained in a joint work with J. Lang and A. Medvedovsky. We also hint at what
                            is known and expected in the higher-dimensional case, and how this can be interpreted in terms
                            of p-adic Langlands functoriality.
