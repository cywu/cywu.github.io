                        <div class="nuts-item-abstract">
                            I’ll begin with Bost’s generalization of the p-curvature
                            conjecture, and describe the classical geometric concepts at play such
                            as connections, parallel transport, and associated horizontal
                            subbundle. This naturally motivates the discovery of the Gauss-Manin
                            connection on algebraic de Rham cohomology, and its non-abelian
                            analogue due to Simpson. I’ll state Katz’s theorem that the
                            p-curvature conjecture (equivalently, Bost's conjecture) holds for the
                            abelian Gauss-Manin connection, and outline the ingredients to make
                            that statement, such as the Hodge filtration, conjugate filtration,
                            and Kodaira-Spencer map. I’ll then define non-abelian analogues of
                            these objects, and state a theorem which suitably equates them. This
                            is the non-abelian analogue of part 1 (the characteristic p step) of
                            Katz’s theorem, and is progress towards proving Bost for the
                            non-abelian Gauss-Manin connection. There is also a transcendental
                            characteristic 0 part 2 of Katz' theorem, but its non-abelian analogue
                            is more mysterious.
