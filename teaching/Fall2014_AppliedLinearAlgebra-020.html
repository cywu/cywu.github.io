<b>Day/Time:</b> 09:05 A.M. - 09:55 A.M. , M,W,F (09/02/2014 -
12/10/2014)<b><br>
Location:</b> Vincent Hall 1<b><br>
Instructor:</b> Chenyan Wu<br>

<b>Textbook:</b> Applied Linear Algebra by Peter J. Olver and
Chehrzad Shakiban<br>
<b>Course Description:</b> This course basically covers Chapters 1,
2, 3, 5, 7 and 8 of the textbook.
<p>You should have already taken a one-semester course in Linear
Algebra. The following knowledge is assumed: systems of linear
equations, Gaussian elimination, determinants, vector spaces,
linear independence, basis and dimension. However I will review
these briefly.</p>
<p>New topics include the Cramer's rule, the row, column spaces,
linear transformations, inner product, orthogonality, the
Gram-Schmidt algorithm, eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
diagonalization, hermitian matrices, the singular value
decomposition, quadratic forms, positive definite matrices and the
Jordan canonical forms. The lectures follow the text fairly
closely.</p>
<p><b>Homework:</b> Assignments will be posted below. The cut-off
time of due date is at 2:00 P.M. Late homework is not acceptable.
Discussion among students are encouraged, but everyone must write
his/her own solution. Copying is not allowed and university policy
applies to those who are found copying. When writing homework
present your arguments along with math formulae instead of simply
piling up formulae. Be concise and include only related arguments.
To avoid losing points unnecessarily do not make the grader guess
what you mean. Read the assignments carefully. You do not get
partial credits for doing wrong problems.</p>
<p><b>Exams Schedules (tentative):</b></p>
<p>Midterm 1: Oct. 1 in class</p>
<p>Midterm 2: Nov. 5 in class</p>
<p>The final is projected to take place at 1:30 p.m.-3:30 p.m.,
Tuesday, Dec. 16.</p>
<p><b>Grading:</b> The final grade is produced using the following
recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework 30% (with the worst score dropped)</li>
<li>Each Midterm 20%</li>
<li>The final 30%.</li>
<li>The grades will not be curved.<br>
<br></li>
</ul>
<b>Other Policies:</b> Hand-held calculators can be used during
exams in this course. Notes and textbooks are not allowed.<br>
<br>
<b>Scholastic Conduct:</b> Discussion on homework problems among
students are encouraged. However it is forbidden to simply copy
homework. Cheating or other misconduct will not be tolerated and
standard university policies will apply.<br>
<br>

expectations, and grading standards are at:<br>
