		<h2>Math 5248: Cryptology and Number Theory Section 002</h2>
		This page will be updated as more information becomes available.
		<p><b>Day/Time:</b> 02:30 P.M. - 03:45 P.M., T,Th (01/21/2014 -
		    05/09/2014)<br>
		    <b>Location:</b> Vincent Hall 113<br>
		    <b>Instructor:</b> Chenyan Wu<br>
		    <b>Contact Information:</b> cywu "at" math.umn.edu<br>
		    <b>Office Hours and Location:</b> 03:45 P.M. - 05:00 P.M., T, Th at
		    VinH 302<br>
		    <b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp;<b style="font-style: italic;">Cryptology and
			Number Theory</b> by <a href=
"http://www.math.umn.edu/%7Egarrett/crypto/" target="_blank">Paul
			Garrett</a>,&nbsp;available at Alpha Print. Used copies from
		    previous years, produced by Alpha Print, are the same. However, the
		    first edition, printed by the publisher, has substantial
		    differences, and would not suffice.</p>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional material:</span> Web
		page from 2003 version of the course, with lecture overheads, etc.
		at <a href="http://www.math.umn.edu/%7Egarrett/crypto/">Paul
		    Garrett's home page</a>. You might also find some useful textbooks
		that are available freely (and legally) online,<br>
		Victor Shoup's <b>"A Computational Introduction to Number Theory
		    and Algebra"</b>, <a href="http://shoup.net/ntb/">Shoup
		    book</a>,<br>
		William Stein's <b>"Elementary Number Theory: Primes, Congruences,
		    and Secrets"</b>, <a href=
					 "http://modular.math.washington.edu/ent/">Stein book</a> and<br>
		For popular historical accounts of cryptology, highly recommended
		sources are Simon Singh, <b>"The Code Book"</b> and (for much more
		detail) David Kahn, <b>"The Codebreakers"</b>.<br>
		<br>
		Being able to program is certainly very helpful but not essential
		for this course. Some computer algebra systems may come in handy:
		Sage, Maple, Mathematica, etc.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Course Objectives:</span> This
		course develops the basic ideas of cryptology and related areas of
		number theory. Both symmetric and public key cryptosystems will be
		introduced, as will random number generators and cryptographic
		protocols.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Homework:</span> Weekly
		assignments will be posted on <a href=
						 "http://moodle.umn.edu/">Moodle</a> and are due at the beginning of
		class every Thursday. Later homework will not be accepted. When
		writing homework please present it in such a way that people who
		are not using our textbook can understand your reasoning. Be
		concise and include only related arguments. To avoid losing points
		unnecessarily do not make the grader guess what you mean.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Exam Dates:</span> Feb. 27, April
		3 and May 8. We don't have a final on May 17.<br>
		&nbsp;<br>
		Exams are open-book, open-notes and calculators are allowed.
		However communication devices such as smart phones, iPads are not
		allowed. In exams you are on your own. No discussion is
		allowed.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Grades:</span> Homework
		contributes 30%, exams 20% + 20% + 30%.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Scholastic Conduct:</span>
		Discussion on homework problems among students are encouraged.
		However it is forbidden to simply copy homework. Cheating or other
		misconduct will not be tolerated and standard university policies
		will apply.<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">University Policy
		    Statements:</span> The University Senate statements regarding
		academic dishonesty, credit, and workload expectations, and grading
		standards are at:<br>
		<a href=
		   "http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/GRADINGTRANSCRIPTS.html">
		    http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/GRADINGTRANSCRIPTS.html</a>
		and<br>
		<a href=
		   "http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/STUDENTWORK.html">
		    http://policy.umn.edu/Policies/Education/Education/STUDENTWORK.html</a>.<br>

		<br>
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">Workload:</span> One credit is
		defined as equivalent to an average of three hours of learning
		effort per week (over a full semester) necessary for an average
		student to achieve an average grade in the course. This course is a
		4 credit course that meets 3 hours per week. Therefore, you should
		expect to spend an additional 9 hours per week on coursework
		outside the classroom.<br>
